# Introduction / Purpose :

This R based Tool/script helps user to visualize change in Inverse Simpsons Index / Alpha Diversity over period of time in Patient Gut Microbiota 

# Input : 

Patient Details :

Patient Name 
ISI over period of two time points (pre_fmt , day 15 and day 28)
Patient donor name, donor ISI  and donor alpha diversity.


# Calculation of ISI and Alpha Diversity : 

Computing ISI and Alpha diversity from ONT 16S fastq files is done by our previous pipeline: https://github.com/arpit20328/Nextflow-Pipeline-for-16S-Nanopore-Data-Analysis/tree/main
